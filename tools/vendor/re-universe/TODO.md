# RE-Universe Platform - Production TODO List

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Required for Full Functionality)

### **High Priority - Complete These First**

- [x] **Add API Keys to .env file**
  - [x] OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
  - [x] Anthropic API key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`
  - [x] GitHub token: `GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...`

- [x] **Restart services after API key configuration**
  ```bash
  docker-compose restart ai-orchestration github-mining
  ```

- [x] **Restore BSim database** (399,848 functions available)
  - Complete backup from Feb 3rd available
  - Restores full production dataset

- [x] **Verify system after configuration**
  ```bash
  ./health-check.sh
  ./integration-tests.sh
  ```

## 🔧 PRODUCTION HARDENING

### **Security**
- [ ] Change default database password in production
- [ ] Configure SSL/HTTPS with Traefik
- [ ] Set `DJANGO_DEBUG=False` for production
- [ ] Review and harden service configurations

### **Performance**
- [ ] Adjust Docker resource allocations based on load
- [ ] Configure database connection pooling
- [ ] Set up Redis persistence policies

### **Monitoring**
- [ ] Configure alerting based on established baselines
- [ ] Set up log aggregation if needed
- [ ] Configure automated backup verification

## 📈 OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### **Advanced Features**

- [x] Restart policies added to all services
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts
- [ ] Document custom procedures
- [ ] Train team on system operation

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After completing above items:

- [ ] All services show "healthy" in monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Integration tests achieve >95% success rate
- [ ] Response times within established baselines
- [ ] AI services responding with API keys configured
