# Pin to Node 24 LTS: that's the floor for stable node:sqlite
# (the DB backing of this project). Node 22 can run with
# --experimental-sqlite but the extra flag isn't worth the risk.

# dependencies across rebuilds that touch only source files.

# Then the rest of the tree. `dist/` is gitignored so we rebuild from
# `src/` here — the published layer never carries a stale compile.

# ---- stage 2: runtime ---------------------------------------
# -slim gets us a Debian base with glibc; needed because Frida and
# some plugin tooling expect dynamic linker/libstdc++ at runtime,
# which Alpine would make awkward. Still only ~75 MiB base.

# 10,000+ files. ~18 MiB vs the 19 GiB raw tree.
